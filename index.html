		<p> This past summer I traveled to Cusco, Peru for about 3 weeks. I worked in an Orphanage during the weeks and I hiked Machu Picchu on the weekends. Machu Picchu is located just a few hours away and can be reached via train.<a class= "mylinks" href="http://www.perurail.com/?gclid=CIqSi6G_8soCFYMkhgodsC0PyQ" target="_blank">Peru Rail </a>. is one train company that travels to Machu PIcchu. We traveled on Peru rail from Cusco to Aguas Calientes where we spent the night before climbing Machu Picchu. Aguas Calientes is a tourist town at the bottom of Machu Picchu that is famous for it's hot springs. <a class= "mylinks" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/cuzco-and-the-sacred-valley/aguas-calientes" target="_blank"> Aguas Calientes, Town of Machu Picchu.</a> </p>


		<h2>History</h2>
		<p> 

			Machu Picchu holds so much historic meaning and means a lot to the citizens of Peru. Machu Picchu was built and inhabited starting in 1450, or at the start of the Incan empire. It was abandoned when the natives were threatened by the Spanish Conquest and the violence9. <a class= "mylinks" href= "http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/machu-picchu/#/machu-picchu-stairs_92485_600x450.jpg" target="_blank"> Visit National Geographic </a> for more information</p>


		<h3> Weather </h3>


		<p>
			Since Machu Picchu is located in Peru it is in the Southern Hemisphere. Due to this the warm, moderate temperatures occur during the May through September months while the cold, rainier months are during the October through April. However, since Machu Picchu is located at 7,000 feet it generally stays moderate through all months although precipitation does vary. <a class= "mylinks" href= http://www.howtotraveltomachupicchu.com/travel-tips/machu-picchu-weather target= "_blank"> For Monthly Weather Reports Click Here </a>
